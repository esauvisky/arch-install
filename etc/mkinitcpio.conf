# Modules
# The following modules are loaded before any boot hooks are run.
# Enable Direct Rendering Manager KMS (needs kernel params!)
# MODULES=(i915 amdgpu)
MODULES=(i915 nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)

# BINARIES
# This setting includes any additional binaries a given user may
# wish into the CPIO image.  This is run last, so it may be used to
# override the actual binaries included by a given hook
# BINARIES are dependency parsed, so you may safely ignore libraries
BINARIES=(/usr/bin/btrfs)

# FILES
# This setting is similar to BINARIES above, however, files are added
# as-is and are not parsed in any way.  This is useful for config files.
FILES=()

# HOOKS
# This is the most important setting in this file.  The HOOKS control the
# modules and scripts added to the image, and what happens at boot time.
# Order is important, and it is recommended that you do not change the
# order in which HOOKS are added.  Run 'mkinitcpio -H <hook name>' for
# help on a given hook.
# 'base' is _required_ unless you know precisely what you are doing.
# 'udev' is _required_ in order to automatically load modules
# 'filesystems' is _required_ unless you specify your fs modules in MODULES
HOOKS=(base udev autodetect modconf keyboard keymap block encrypt RESUME resume btrfs usr fsck shutdown)
