# About this repo

_This contains various files and no documentation._

_As long as you're already 'round here, check out my [.bashrc](dotfiles/.bashrc), it's a work of art._

This is just for me:

> It looks like it's a good practice to make hard links instead of soft ones if I want to automatically update the changes in tracked files on this repo.
> Unfortunately I don't remember why, and I ain't got time to research, at least for now.

> **Note to myself: remember we lost our sacred .bashrc because of this. Fix it, I beg you, future @esauvisky.**

> More up-to-date note: we (me and myself) should actually go with a [script](https://github.com/bashdot/bashdot) [solution](https://github.com/rhysd/dotfiles), because hard-links undo themselves if git touches them.
> Someday.
