# About this repo

_This contains various files and no documentation._

This is just for me:

> It looks like it's a good practice to make hard links instead of soft ones if I want to automatically update the changes in tracked files on this repo.
> Unfortunately I don't remember why, and I ain't got time to research, at least for now.

**Note to myself: remember we lost our sacred .bashrc because of this. Fix it, I beg you, future @esauvisky.**
